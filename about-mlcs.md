**"Machine Learning in Climate Science" (MLCS)** is an independent
junior research group established in January 2020 within the framework
of the [Cluster of Excellence "Machine
Learning"](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/)
at the University of Tübingen.

MLCS aims to understand and predict different components of the climate
system based on present-day and paleoclimatic data sets, used along with
the output of climate models. Climatic phenomena of interest include the
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Global Monsoon (GM), and the
Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The changes in the state of
these climatic systems are consequential to people all around the
planet, and they inform global socio-economic decisions at all levels of
societal organization. The ideas we use to infer nontrivial features
from climatic data fall broadly under the category of Machine Learning
(ML) approaches, which are evidently suited to the task: to identify,
classify, and predict complex patterns.
