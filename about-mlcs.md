**"Machine Learning in Climate Science"** is an independent junior
research group established in January 2020 within the framework of the
[Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning"]
(https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/)
at the University of TÃ¼bingen. The group is led by [Bedartha Goswami]
(https://mlcs.github.io/people/goswami/), who has previously worked at
the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]
(https://www.pik-potsdam.de/) and at the [Remote Sensing and Earth
Surface Processes] (https://up-rs-esp.github.io/) group at the
University of Potsdam. The group aims to quantify, understand, and
predict different components of the climate system based on current and
paleoclimatic data sets, along with the output of climate models.
