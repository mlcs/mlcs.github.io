Presentation of recap in class; Written final assignment


### About the course

The course will cover the following topics related to
non-neural-network-based machine learning:

- Neural networks for tabular data, images, and sequences
- Autoencoders
- Representation Learning
- Graph embeddings
- Regularisation, Optimisation, Approximate Inference


### Teaching methods

The lectures are designed to be interactive and dialogic. Lectures are
going to be conducted with a black board (no slide presentation).
Tutorials will be conducted with a laptop.

### Learning target

At the end of the course, students will posses a basic understanding of
what is deep learning and what are the basic tools and techniques
that it can offer us to model patterns in complex data by learning smart
and efficient representaions.


### Keywords

machine learning, statistics, complex networks, clustering, regression
