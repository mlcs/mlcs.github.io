### About the course

The course aims to discuss the state-of-the-art in machine learning
approaches that are used to address problems in climate research. It
will first introduce the fundamentals of climate dynamics and the
principles of atmospheric and oceanic circulation. The basics of climate
data analytical approaches for both current and paleoclimatic time
scales will also be covered. Following this, classical statistical
learning approaches such as unsupervised clustering, component analysis,
and trend tests will be covered. Next, the course will delve into
artificial neural network based approaches that have been used to
address predictive problems in climate. Additional topics include the
use of complex network approaches in studying climate systems will also
be introduced and the use of artificial neural networks in general
circulation models.

### Teaching methods

The lectures are designed to be interactive and dialogic, and will
involve lectures as well as the reading of current journal articles. The
final evaluation will be on the basis of of an oral presentation and a
written report.

### Learning target

At the end of the course, students will posses a basic understanding of
how the climate works, and of how we measure our current and past
climates. They will be able to review the current literature on relevant
problems in climate science and be able to relate those problems to
relevant machine learning approaches that can be used to tackle them.
