## Bio

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Tuebingen. Currently I am in the last phase of my Bachelor degree of Media and Computer Science and I am writing my thesis in the group of Machine Learning in Climate Science. My interest in this group aroused by my general interest in natural sciences as well as my personal intereset in nature, climate and weather through my hobbies of climbing and mountaineering. Therefore, this group and this thesis combines my personal interests with my academical interests in a perfect way.
