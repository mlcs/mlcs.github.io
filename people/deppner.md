## Bio

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Tübingen. Currently
I am in the last phase of my Bachelor degree of Media and Computer
Science and I am writing my thesis in the group of Machine Learning in
Climate Science. My interest in this group aroused by my general
interest in natural sciences as well as my personal interest in nature,
climate and weather through my hobbies of climbing and mountaineering.
Therefore, this group and this thesis combines my personal interests
with my academical interests in a perfect way.
