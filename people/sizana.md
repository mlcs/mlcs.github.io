## CV

I obtained both my BA in Literature and my MA in Media Studies at the
University of Milan, Italy. After working for two Italian publishers, I
moved to Germany, where I worked as a project manager for a translation
company. In September 2020, I joined the Cluster of Excellence “Machine
Learning.” In my free time I teach Italian (my native language), read
and cook a lot and travel whenever I can.  Recently, I have started to
take interest in sustainable fashion.
