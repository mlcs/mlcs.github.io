#### Research Interests
- General climate data analysis
- Event synchronization methods
- Explainable community detection
- Climate networks

#### Bio
I am a computer science student at the University of Tübingen. Currently, I am
working on my master thesis in the Machine Learning in Climate Science group.
I have been interested in this group since taking a seminar on machine
learning approaches in climate science.  In my free time I do some volunteer
work, go running, keep some bees and love nature.

### Benedict Röder

Benedict completed his Master's thesis on **Parameter Inference and
Uncertainty Quantification for an intermediate complexity climate
model** in August 2022.

#### Research Interests

I'm a computer science student currently working on my master's thesis.
- Hybrid Machine Learning / Physics-informed Machine Learning
- Modelling and predicting the El Niño Southern Oscillation
- Reinforcement Learning
- Robotics

### Ranganatha B R

![PH-ProfilePic](/img/placeholder_profile_pic.png){: .center-block :}

#### Research Interests

I find working with networks extremely intriguing. Studying complex
phenomena on networks is the basis on which I have selected my projects. My
main research interests are
1. Deep Neural Networks in Climate Sciences
2. Complex networks and Network Science
3. Computational Neuroscience
4. Computational social sciences

#### Bio

I am highly motivated to study science from an interdisciplinary point of
view. Even though I major as a Physics student from IISER-T, each of my
projects have incorporated aspects from multiple disciplines. I really
enjoy working on toy computational models and visualizations like an
airplane filling model and backing it up with some preliminary statistical
analysis.

I really enjoy participating in science quizzes and competitions and
listening to and playing music is my favourite activity of any day.
Grooming plants, painting are some of my other interests. I tend to make as
many friends as possible and don't hesitate to make an effort for new
connections.

## CV

I obtained both my BA in Literature and my MA in Media Studies at the
University of Milan, Italy. After working for two Italian publishers, I
moved to Germany, where I worked as a project manager for a translation
company. In September 2020, I joined the Cluster of Excellence “Machine
Learning.” In my free time I teach Italian (my native language), read
and cook a lot and travel whenever I can.  Recently, I have started to
take interest in sustainable fashion.
