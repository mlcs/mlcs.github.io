## Bio
I am a computer science student at the University of Tübingen. Currently, I am
working on my master thesis in the Machine Learning in Climate Science group.
I have been interested in this group since taking a seminar on machine
learning approaches in climate science.  In my free time I do some volunteer
work, go running, keep some bees and love nature.
