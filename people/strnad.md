## Research Interests
I am a complex systems physicists investigating monsoon dynamics and the spatial distribution of extreme rainfall events by the means of: 
+ Climate data analysis (reanalysis, satellites, meteorological and
    hydrological station networks)
+ Nonlinear data analysis like climate networks and probilistic community detection methods
+ Ricci-curvature based analysis of complex networks
+ event synchronization methods
+ Reinforcement Learning
