## Research Interests
I am a complex systems physicists with a special interest on: 
+ Nonlinear time series analysis like climate networks and probilistic machine learning methods
+ Global teleconnection structures of modes of variability (e.g. El Nino-Southern Oscillation)
+ Spatial Organization of Extreme Rainfalls

## CV

I obtained my Bachelor in Physics at the Georg-August University of Göttingen, followed by a specialization in Master of Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Göttingen. During my universtiy studies I spent one year at the University of Pisa. My Master's thesis I wrote at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). I spent one further year as a research assistant at PIK in the Real Estimate Climate Asset Mapping Project (RECAM). Since September 2020, I'm a PhD student in the Machine Learning in Climate Science group at the University of Tübingen and I'm part of the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). 
Beside science, in my free-time I play in an orchestra, love to go running and doing sports.
