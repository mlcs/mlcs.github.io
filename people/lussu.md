## Bio
I'm a Bachelor's student studying Media Informatics and I'm currently writing
my bachelor's thesis at MLCS.  My interests during my studies were mainly
focussed on topics such as web development and human-computer interaction.
While looking for a bachelor's thesis, my general interest in nature and
geography and wanting to look into machine learning methods caught my interest
in the highly relevant topics of machine learning and climate science, even
though they differ from the main elements of Media Informatics.  Generally
speaking about myself, I love to get in contact with peoples from all kinds of
cultures, exploring music from all around the world and I live in Freiburg
next to the Black Forest, so I often go out mountainbiking there.
