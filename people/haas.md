*** 

In general, I am interested in finding guarantees for and limitations of
machine learning algorithms, as well as suitable inductive biases in the
climate science context.

For my current project, I study pitfalls and possible improvements in climate
network construction.

## Research Interests

+ High-dimensional Probability
+ Ensemble Methods
+ Calibrated Uncertainty Quantification
+ Graph Neural Networks
+ Representation Learning
+ Bayesian Inference
+ Distribution Shifts
+ Overparametrization

## CV

I studied Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg with a focus on
Mathematical Statistics and Machine Learning. In my master thesis I analyized
the convergence rates of Wasserstein GANs with ReLU networks. In May 2021, I
started my PhD under joint supervision of Ulrike von Luxburg in the Theory of
Machine Learning group (TML) at Tuebingen university, computer science
department, and Bedartha Goswami from the MLCS group. I am a scholar in the
International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS), a
graduate school for PhD students from both university and Max-Planck-Institute
in Tuebingen and Stuttgart.
