## Research Interests
I am researching spatio-temporal neural networks for physical processes. 

Project goals:
- Seasonal forecasts of climate quantities (e.g. precipitation and temperature)
- Predicting extreme event statistics
- Exploiting teleconnection patterns to improve forecast skill

Methods:
- Recurrent, convolutional and graph neural networks
- Attention

## Bio
My background is in cognitive science, with a primary interest in learning and
general (artificial) intelligence. 

Machine learning is the focus of my research with climate science providing an
amazingly complex, challenging and important source of data.

In my free time I enjoy bouldering, reading and playing games.
