## Research Interests
I am researching spatio-temporal neural networks for climate processes.
The goal of my work is to enable deep learning forecasts of climate events
on seasonal-to-subseasonal scales.

Topics of interest include the tropical pacific with its characteristic
El Nino Southern Oscillation pattern, as well as the Madden-Julian Oscillation
and its effect on extreme rainfall in southeast Asia.

Methodologically I am interested in self-supervised learning, generative models
and conditioning methods for scalable Transformer architectures.

## Bio
My background is in cognitive science, with a primary interest in learning and
general (artificial) intelligence. During my studies I worked on decision-making
and learning of categories, analysis of MR images and collective information 
processing.

Machine learning has been the focus of my studies and research throughout
and climate science is now providing an amazingly complex, challenging and 
important source of data to explore.
I am mainly interested in methodological underpinnings of spatio-temporal models.

In my free time I enjoy bouldering, reading and playing games.
