## Bio

During my master's studies, I focused on machine learning, artificial
intelligence, and robotics.  The advancements in machine learning over the
last years are astonishing and I would like to utilize these new tools in
other scientific fields.  Climate science is one of the most fascinating
settings due to the sheer amount of data, unknown complex couplings, and the
general impact of climate.  Of special interest to me is the integration of
physical knowledge into machine learning algorithms.
