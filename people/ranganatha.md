## Research Interests

I find working with networks extremely intriguing. Studying complex
phenomena on networks is the basis on which I have selected my projects. My
main research interests are
1. Deep Neural Networks in Climate Sciences
2. Complex networks and Network Science
3. Computational Neuroscience
4. Computational social sciences

## Bio

I am highly motivated to study science from an interdisciplinary point of
view. Even though I major as a Physics student from IISER-T, each of my
projects have incorporated aspects from multiple disciplines. I really
enjoy working on toy computational models and visualizations like an
airplane filling model and backing it up with some preliminary statistical
analysis.

I really enjoy participating in science quizzes and competitions and
listening to and playing music is my favourite activity of any day.
Grooming plants, painting are some of my other interests. I tend to make as
many friends as possible and don't hesitate to make an effort for new
connections.
