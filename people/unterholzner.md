## Bio
I am a cognitive science bachelor student at the University of Tübingen.
Currently I am working on my bachelor thesis with the research group machine
learning in climate science. I find it worthwhile to apply the statistical and
computational foundation of my studies on real world climate data as climate
research is highly impactful on our everyday lifes. In my spare time I enjoy
nature, riding my bicycle and surfing.
