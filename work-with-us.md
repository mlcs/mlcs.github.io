MLCS welcomes highly motivated researchers at all stages of their
careers to tackle challenging problems in climate science. A background
in Computer Science, Physics, or Mathematics is ideal. Prior experience
with machine learning methods such unsupervised learning, causality
inference, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep neural networks is
preferred.

## Doctoral and postdoctoral projects

Please send a brief summary of your background and research interests
(one page), a rough sketch of the research questions that you would like
to work on (one page), and a brief CV (one page).  Also keep in mind
that applications to third-party funding may be necessary.

## Bachelors and Masters theses projects

If you are interested in doing your Bachelors or Masters thesis project
