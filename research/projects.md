### Predicting Sea Surface Temperature Patterns in the Pacific Ocean
The biggest climate variability on an interdecadel scale is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  ENSO events are mainly characterized by the equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Pacific. These conditions have high impact on global climate, as for instance intense rainfall over Peru and droughts and wildfires in Northern Australia during the ENSO warm phase, known as El Nino.  Although ENSO is an important climate phenomena, its cause and variability is not yet fully understood which makes it hard for climate models to capture and predict its occurrence.
In this project, we aim to forecast the equatorial SST anomaly patterns in the Pacific from a data driven approach. Using probabilistic generative models allows for spatial predictions with uncertainties as well as insights into underlying drivers. Our final goal are local SST forecasts from a global perspective.
