The independent research group "Machine Learning in Climate Science" was
established officially in January this year with Bedartha Goswami as its
helm. It aims to investigate climate processes and unravel the
complexity of climatic systems with tools and techniques from the wide
domain of machine learning.

This website will the space where our group will share our work, our
activities outside of work, and our ups and downs as we navigate the
interface of state-of-the-art data analytical concepts and hard-to-crack
climate questions.

So... Watch this space!
