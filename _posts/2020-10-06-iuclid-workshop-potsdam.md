I attended the 'Workshop on Uncertainties' organised at the Potsdam
Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) Potsdam last week from 29
September to 2 October 2020. Keynote lectures from [Sune
Rasmussen](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/49156){:target="_blank"},
[Maarten Blaauw](http://www.chrono.qub.ac.uk/blaauw/){:target="_blank"},
[Nadine Berner](https://www.nadineberner.eu/){:target="_blank"}, and
[Rebecca
Morisson](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/rebecca-morrison){:target="_blank"}
covered several interesting aspects of uncertainties. Topics included:
how (and why) ice core uncertainties are set conservatively (Rasmussen),
how we can use Bayesian principles to infer age models from measured
radiometric data (Blaauw), structural aspects of change point detection
(Berner), and learning unknown extensions of models to fit data better
(Morisson).

The workshop was also a great chance to see young researchers in action!
In particular, [Keno
Reichers](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/riechers){:target="_blank"}
(PIK) presented an creative way to determine the lag between the onset
of abrupt transitions in two proxy records obtained from Greenland ice
cores.  Tobias Braun (PIK) presented a new way to obtain seasonal
variability from stalagmite proxy records which have been modeled using
[COPRA](https://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/copra.php){:target="_blank"}.
[Annabel Wolf](https://twitter.com/AnnabelWlf){:target="_blank"}
presented work from her newly published paper
([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73508-z){:target="_blank"})
which discusses how rainfall in central Vietnam is controlled by two
moisture sources, viz. the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, as
revealed by stable oxygen isotope data.

[Torben
Kunz](https://www.awi.de/ueber-uns/organisation/mitarbeiter/torben-kunz.html){:target="_blank"}
(AWI) presented recent work
([link](https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/16/1469/2020/){:target="_blank"})
which successfully decomposes the power spectrum of a paleoclimatic
proxy into components that account for the different factors that go
into estimating the proxy record from the measurements. The study does
assume, however, that there is no age modeling involved but the results
do look promising! The next extension of their approach, which would
ideally include age modeling as well, is something to look forward to.


In a COVID-19 world, most of the participants acknowledged that it felt
good to be meeting _in persona_, notwithstanding face masks, physical
distancing, et al.
