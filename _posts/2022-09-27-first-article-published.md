In the beginning of September, [our
article](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL098571)
on how the type of El Niño, i.e. whether it is centered in the Central
Pacific or the Eastern Pacific, influences its global correlation
patterns got published in _Geophysical Research Letters_. We use the
concept of curvature for complex networks to differentiate short-range
and long-range links in climate networks constructed from surface air
temperature data from the last 70 years. We find that Central Pacfic El
Niños have drastically different correlation patterns than Eastern
Pacific ones, and that the Central Pacific region itself is rather
uncorrelated during both Central Pacific and Eastern Pacific warming
events.
